### What do you do for a living?

I procrastinate. I tinker with stuff. I also think, or at least I look like
as I'm thinking. And then I procrastinate again.

### What do you tinker with?

Mostly OpenStack, which is plagued by my wild commits and pedant reviews.
In general I tend to be attracted by software whose purpose is to send stuff
from one place to another; but I'm not into shipping.

Also, I tinker with other stuff such as raspberry PIs, astronomy, and modelism.

### Do you happen to also do actual, useful, productive, work?

What people usually refer to as "work" is actually a byproduct of my
procrastination. Basically I happen to do some "work" even if that is not my
intention.

### Where do you procrastinate from?

After spending over 7 years in Cambridge, UK, I am now living in Naples, Italy;
there are plenty of ideas for procrastination here.

### Why did you feel compelled to share your procrastination with the rest of the world?

Because procrastination matters, and I want to contribute to ensure that
the values of procrastination and indocelence are properly imbued into the
new generations.

Also, meh.

### Do you have a life beyond procrastination?

Yes, I do have a beautiful wife, and and a gorgeous 1-year old son.
