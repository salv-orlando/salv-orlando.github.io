### What do I do for a living?

I procrastinate. I tinker with stuff. I also think. And then I procrastinate again.

### What do you tinker with?

Mostly OpenStack, which is plagued by my wild commits and pedant reviews.
In general I tend to be attracted by networking software (note: I did not write
software-defined networking).
Also, I tinker with other stuff such as raspberry PIs, astronomy, and modelism.

### Do you happen to also do actual, useful, productive, work?

What people usually refer to as "work" is a byproduct of my procrastination.
Basically I happen to do some "work" even if that is not my intention.

### Where do you procrastinate from?

After spending over 7 years in Cambridge, UK. I am now living in Naples, Italy;
there are plenty of ideas for procrastination here.

### How often do you write?

I'd say on an occasional basis.

### Do you have a life beyond procrastination?

Yes, I do have a beautiful wife, and and even more gorgeous 1-year old son.
